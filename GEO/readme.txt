All of the data submitted to GEO for DNAm includes data from 269 tissue samples generated from 74 postmortem brain donors. The subset of 264 tissue samples with corresponding count data for expressed genes from RNA-sequencing data is also provided. 
In the GEO submission, we did not include data from the samples that did not pass quality control or did not meet diagnostic criterion. Please see corresponding publication for additional details.
